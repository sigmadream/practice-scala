
The fire is slowly dying,
And my dear, we're still good-by-ing.
But, as long as you love me so,
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It snow

{}

Oh, it doesn't show signs of stopping,
And I've brought some corn for popping,
Since the lights are turned way down low,
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!
